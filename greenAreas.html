				<p>The trees of the forests take up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and
				release oxygen during photosynthesis. They also carry out the opposite process, 
				also known as respiration, but when forests are growing, photosynthesis
				exceeds respiration, and the surplus carbon is stored in tree trunks, roots
				and soil. This is called "sequestration". When forests are cut down, much
				of that stored carbon is released into the atmosphere again as carbon dioxide.
				 This is how deforestation and forest degradation contribute to global warming.
				Here's a choropleth map showing the amount of forests in European countries 
				expressed in hectares (ha). Move the cursor on the countries to see details.

				<p>Sweden, Spain and Finland are the countries with the highest amount of forests.
				 In general, all European countries increased the amount of forests, but France
				is the country which registered the most important increase in wooded areas from 
				1990 to 2020.</br>
				Utilised agricultural areas (UAA) can be classified into three types: low 
				intensity, medium intensity and high intensity. A UAA is classified under 
				the class "low intensity" if the amount of money spent for inputs is lower than
				88 euros/hectare. A UAA is classified under the class "medium intensity" if the
				amount of money spent for inputs is between 88 euros/hectares and 560 
				euros/hectare.  A UAA is classified under the class "high intensity" if the
				amount of money spent for inputs is greater than 560 euros/hectare.
				The inputs are fertilisers, soil improvers, pesticides and other means of 
				protection such as traps and baits, bird scarers, anti-hail shells, frost 
				protection and purchased feed. These kinds of inputs are toxic and they damage the 
				soil, the plants and the animals, so it's necessary to use them as little as 
				possible. Here's a choropleth map about the amount of areas 
				dedicated to the agriculture of European countries, expressed in hectares (ha). 
				Move the cursor on the countries to see details. Choose the year and the type of 
				intensity using the bottoms.</p>

				<p>From the choropleth map above, it's possible to observe that from 2010 to 2019,
				 many European countries increased the amount of high-intensity UAA, instead of
				 reducing them. </br>
				Here's a scatterplot to represent the distribution of the most important 
				European countries considering their amount of wooded areas (Y-axis) concerning
				their total UAA (X-axis), both expressed in hectares (ha). Move the cursors on the 
				dots to see details. Choose the year using the bottom.</p>

				<p>Sweden and Finland are the countries whose amount of forests is much higher
				than the amount of UAA. France, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark, Ireland 
				and especially UK, instead, are the countries whose amount of wooded areas is 
				quite low concerning UAA.</br>
				How to maintain a high amount of wooded areas and UAA at the same time? The
				solution is agroforestry: a land use management system in which trees or shrubs
				are grown among crops or pastureland. Here's a picture of this technique.</p>
