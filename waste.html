			<div id="p">
				<p>Poor waste management contributes to climate change and air pollution and
				directly affects many ecosystems and species. Waste management is broken down 
				into six types of treatment: landfilling, incineration with energy recovery, 
				incineration without energy recovery, recycling, backfilling and other disposals.
				Waste treatments are evaluated according to the following waste hierarchy:</p>

			<div id="p">
				<p>A landfill (disposal category) is a site to collect and store waste that is 
				going to be transported and treated. Landfills release methane, the very powerful 
				greenhouse gas linked to climate change. Methane is formed by microorganisms 
				present in landfills from biodegradable waste, such as food, paper and garden 
				waste. Depending on the way they are built, landfills might also contaminate soil
				and water, so it's important to reduce them as much as possible. Incineration is 
				the process of combustion that converts waste into ash, flue gas and heat. 
				It releases gases that contribute to air pollution and the greenhouse effect. 
				Through this process, is possible to produce electric energy (recovery 
				category). When the production of electric energy from incineration is not possible,
				it's classified in the disposal category. Recycling (corresponding category) is 
				the process of conversion of waste into new materials and objects. This practice 
				reduces the consumption of fresh raw materials, energy use, greenhouse gas 
				emissions, air pollution (from incineration) and water pollution (from 
				landfilling). Backfilling (reuse category) is the process to transform waste into
				new products without pre-treatments. Backfilling and recycling are reinforced by 
				waste sorting. Here's a percentage stacked bar chart to consult how some 
				European countries manage their waste. Move the cursor on the bars to see 
				details. Click on the button to choose the year you're interested in. 
				Mineral waste isn't included.</p>

				<p>From the above bar chart, it's possible to observe that from 2010 to 2020, most
				of European countries increased recycled waste, especially Italy, Netherlands, 
				Croatia, Belgium and Slovenia. Belgium is the European country with the best waste
				management: more than 85% of its waste is recycled in 2020. 
				In other countries, recycling isn't still the main treatment, especially in 
				Finland, Malta and Poland.</br>
				Here's a scatterplot to show economic losses, expressed in millions of euro, of 
				some European countries concerning their waste, expressed in tons (t), that isn't
				recycled or backfilled. Through the button, choose the year you're interested in.

				<p>From the above chart, it's possible to observe in general that the more the 
				waste isn't recycled or backfilled, the more the economic losses increase. This 
				fact explains the importance of the circular economy. A circular economy is an 
				eco-friendly model of production and consumption which can regenerate on its own
				forever. It involves techniques such as reusing, repairing, refurbishing and 
				recycling existing materials and products. Here's a clarifying schema:</p>
