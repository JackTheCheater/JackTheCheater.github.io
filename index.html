				<p>Global warming is the ongoing increase in global average temperature that
				causes long-term changes to Earth's climate from which it derives the term 
				"Climate Change". This current rise in global average temperature is primarily 
				caused by fossil fuel use, deforestation and some agricultural, industrial and 
				waste management practices that increase the greenhouse effect. What's the 
				greenhouse effect? Here's an animated explanation:</p>

			<div id="p">
				<p>The greenhouse effect is a process that occurs when energy from a planet's
				host star goes through the planet's atmosphere and heats the planet's surface, but
				greenhouse gases in the atmosphere prevent most of the heat from returning 
				directly to space, so they make the planet livable with an appropriate temperature
				for life. The greenhouse gases which play the most significant role are 
				carbon dioxide and methane. Increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the 
				atmosphere means increasing the greenhouse effect which traps more heat in
				Earth's lower atmosphere, causing global warming. According to the data provided 
				by GISTEMP (NASA Goddard's Global Surface Temperature Analysis), it's possible to
				observe from the following line chart, how the mean European surface temperature 
				(upper line) and the mean global surface temperature (lower line) variated 
				concerning their corresponding means of the period between 1850 and 1899.

				<p>According to NSF International, Antarctica contains almost 90% of Earth's 
				total ice volume and 70% of its fresh water. The melting of the Arctic and 
				Antarctic ice influences oceanic currents because huge amounts of cold water 
				coming from Antarctica move to hotter oceans slowing down their sea currents and 
				this disrupts the delicate biological balance of the sea ecosystems. The ice melting 
				causes the sea-level rise: if the Arctic should melt completely, the sea level 
				would rise by six meters according to the experts, and a not-negligible amount of
				land would extinguish. The ice melting leads also to changes in the hydrological 
				cycle, causing frequent periods of droughts.</p>
