				<p>Greenhouse gases are responsible for global warming. The biggest amount
				of these gases come from sources which burn fossil fuels, such as coal-fired 
				power plants, diesel-fueled vehicles and many others. Greenhouse gases cause
				climate change which provokes economic damages. The burning of 
				fossil fuels also releases pollutants in the air which are detrimental to human 
				health and the planet as a whole. Dirty air causes major health issues, which 
				have serious consequences for our economy. Air pollution can affect businesses 
				through reduced workforce productivity, work absences, premature deaths and lower
				crop yields. The longer we take to clean the air, the greater the economic costs 
				will be.<br>Here's a line chart showing the evolution of the mean economic loss in 
				Europe (22 countries considered) due to climate change. Move the cursor on the

				<p>From 2004 to 2010, the mean economic loss in Europe had a huge increase. It 
				increased by around EUR 700 million. Then, it decreased with a slow trend.

				<p>The above choropleth map confirms what was said before: economic losses in

				are manmade, which are the most polluting human activities? Here's a bar chart

			<h3 id="introductionTitle">Nuclear Energy</h3>
			<div id="p">
				<p>Nuclear energy is the energy in the nucleus, or core, of an atom. Atoms are 
				tiny units that make up all matter in the universe, and energy is what holds the 
				nucleus together. There is a huge amount of energy in an atom's dense nucleus.
				Nuclear energy can be used to create electricity, but it must first be released 
				from the atom. In the process of nuclear fission, atoms are split to release that 
				energy. A nuclear reactor, or power plant, is a series of machines that can 
				control nuclear fission to produce electricity. The fuel that nuclear reactors 
				use to produce nuclear fission is pellets of the element uranium. In a nuclear 
				reactor, atoms of uranium are forced to break apart. As they split, the atoms 
				release tiny particles called fission products. Fission products cause other 
				uranium atoms to split, starting a chain reaction. The energy released from this 
				chain reaction creates heat. The heat created by nuclear fission warms the 
				reactor's cooling agent. A cooling agent is usually water, but some nuclear 
				reactors use liquid metal or molten salt. The cooling agent, heated by nuclear 
				fission, produces steam. The steam turns turbines, or wheels turned by a flowing 
				current. The turbines drive generators, or engines that create electricity.
				<br>Here's a choropleth map showing the amount of nuclear heat produced by each 
				European country in terms of tons of equivalent oil. Move the cursor on the 
				nations to see details. Click on the button to choose the year you're interested

				<p>France is the European country with the highest production of nuclear heat.
				It's also important to consider the fact that data about many countries are 
				unknown for two reasons: some countries didn't provide any data, and some countries
				don't make use of nuclear energy, like Italy. Nuclear energy has its pros and
				cons: it provides carbon-free electricity, high power output and it's very 
				reliable, but uranium is non-renewable and nuclear waste needs important 
				treatments.<br>Is nuclear energy convenient? Is nuclear energy responsible for 
				economic losses caused by climate change? Here's a scatterplot showing
				the correlations between nuclear heat produced and economic losses due to climate
				change of some European countries. Move the cursor on the dots of the legend to

				<p>From the above chart, it's possible to observe that France is both the nation
				with the highest nuclear heat production and the highest economic losses due to 
				climate change, but there are countries such as Sweden and Spain that make use of 
				nuclear energy and they have less economic losses than countries like Italy and 
				Poland which don't use it. There's no correlation between nuclear energy and 
				derived economic losses.</p>
